# CSS BASIC

Beginner-friendly HTML documents styled with CSS from **Week 5 of the ALX Frontend program**.  
This is a continuation of **Week 4 of the ALX Frontend program (HTML Basics)**.  

Each document is linked to the stylesheet and demonstrates the basic CSS concepts such as:  

- Flexbox layout
- Font styling
- Colors and backgrounds
- Box properties
- Responsive design (works on smartphones)

This repository also follows coding constraints like:  

- Avoiding the installation, import or use of external libraries. Built only with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
- No **NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.**  
- Code is **W3C compliant** and validates with [W3C-Validator](https://github.com/alx-tools/W3C-Validator).
